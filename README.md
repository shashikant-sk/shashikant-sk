## Welcome to my World :. . .
My name is **shashikant** :raising_hand: and I am a 22 year old **Web Developer** :zap: , **Android developer** :lock:, **Ui designer** :artist: , **Researcher** :microscope: and a **Book Worm** :book:. I love learning new stuff :bulb: which has a future/value in the global market. I love increasing connections :two_men_holding_hands: and looking out for every oppurtunity I can grab. I love competitive coding :trident: and spend a fair amount of time :hourglass: going through business case studies or research papers :sparkles:. 

To be a part of a progressive organization that gives scope to enhance my knowledge and skills and reach the pinnacle in the field with sheer determination, dedication and hard work. I am currently working on myself to gain technical knowledge and presentation/communication skills. Am capable of working as a team player or independently. Am currently pursuing my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Engineering from KIIT University.

## Who am I :point_down:?
```python
 from shashikant import personal_details
 # from shashikant_Personal import personal_ambitions
 class WhoAmI:
 	name = 'shashikant'
	current_education = "B.Tech CSE"
	hobbies = [
			'Traveling',
			'Horse Riding',
			'Watching Sci-Fi',
			'Reading Sci-Fi Novels',
			'Learning New Programming Languages or Frameworks',
			'Making friends ...'
			]
			
# return city name ...
def getCity():
	retrun Birgunj_Nepal_Asia_Earth()

# return public ambitions ...
def Ambitions():
	1.) Be ambitious ():-
		 ' Ambition is the first step to Success     '
		 ' Don‚Äùt be afraid to be Ambitious about your Goal  '
		 ' Hard Work Never stops Neither Should Your Dream   '
		 ' and never Let No one discourse Your ambitious Attitude.   ' 
		 ' You Don‚Äôt Need A Fan Club to achive your Goals Be your Own Motivation  '

	2.) Following your passion is not overrated ():-
		 ' I grew up hearing that I should find my passion and pursue a career that I loved.  '
		 ' I‚Äôm sure many of you received similar advice.   '
		 ' When you love what you do, it never feels like work.   '
		 ' For me, finding my passion will prevent you from all the obstacles and pushes you towards   '
		 ' the greatness of life which every person wanted to have.' 
		 ' It will beautify your work as every time you put on some extra efforts in your work task.  '

	3.) Wear your failures like a badge of honor ():-	 
		 ' there is merit in failing if you try '
		 ' to extract valuable lessons from those perceived failures. ' 
		 ' If you learn from a setback  ' 
		 ' it‚Äôs not really a setback but a learning experience‚Äù  ' 

		 ' Failing is great unless it becomes a habit.   ' 
		 ' But it‚Äôs very important to recognize  '
		 ' when certain things just do not fall into place. '
		 ' Always be open to plan B if the plan A doesn‚Äôt work.   '         

	4.) Be The BesT():-
		' Always Do Your Best  '
		' Always remember that you are absolutely unique  '

		    
		# private_ambitions out of scope :-)

	     ‚ÄúOnce you replace negative thoughts with positive ones, you‚Äùll start having positive results.
```
